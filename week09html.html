      <h4>Arepas from Columbia</h4>
      <p>Get ready to tantalize your taste buds with a simple recipe for Colombian cheese arepas! These delightful cornmeal patties with gooey cheese are a popular snack or side dish. Here's what you'll need:

        <br><br>- 2 cups of pre-cooked cornmeal (also known as masarepa)
        <br><br>- 2 cups of warm water
        <br><br>- 1 teaspoon of salt
        <br><br>- 1 cup of grated cheese (traditional options include mozzarella, queso blanco, or queso fresco)
        <br><br>- Vegetable oil for cooking
        
        <br><br>Here's how to make them:
        
        <br><br>1. In a mixing bowl, combine the pre-cooked cornmeal and salt. Gradually add warm water, while mixing with your hands, until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and pliable.
        
        <br><br>2. Divide the dough into small portions and roll each into a ball. Flatten each ball with your hands to create a round patty, about 1/2 inch thick. Make sure the edges are smooth to prevent them from cracking while cooking.
        
        <br><br>3. Take a small amount of grated cheese (about a tablespoon) and place it in the center of one patty. Fold the edges of the patty towards the center, covering the cheese, and gently press to seal. Repeat this step for the remaining dough portions.
        
        <br><br>4. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with vegetable oil. Place the arepas on the skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side until they turn golden brown. You may need to adjust the cooking time depending on the thickness of your arepas.
        
        <br><br>5. Once cooked, transfer the arepas to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.
        
        <br><br>Serve your homemade Colombian cheese arepas warm and enjoy their crispy exterior and oozing cheese center. They're delightful on their own or as a side dish with salsa, avocado, or even as a base for other delicious toppings. ¡Buen provecho!</p>

      <h4>Empanadas of Argentina</h4>
      <p>Get ready to experience the delicious flavors of Argentine empanadas! These savory pastries are a staple in Argentine cuisine. Here's a simple recipe to make your own:

        <br><br>For the dough, you'll need:
        <br><br>- 3 cups of all-purpose flour
        <br><br>- 1 teaspoon of salt
        <br><br>- 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes
        <br><br>- 3/4 cup of cold water
        
        <br><br>For the filling, you can choose from various options, but here's a classic beef filling recipe:
        <br><br>- 1 pound of ground beef
        <br><br>- 1 small onion, finely chopped
        <br><br>- 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
        <br><br>- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
        <br><br>- 1/4 cup of green olives, pitted and chopped
        <br><br>- 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
        <br><br>- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
        <br><br>- 1 teaspoon of ground cumin
        <br><br>- 1 teaspoon of paprika
        <br><br>- Salt and pepper to taste
        
        <br><br>Here's how to make them:
        
        <br><br>1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the chilled butter cubes and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
        
        <br><br>2. Gradually add the cold water, a little at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
        
        <br><br>3. While the dough rests, prepare the filling. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic, and sauté until they become soft and translucent.
        
        <br><br>4. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Stir in the cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for a few minutes, then remove from heat. Stir in the chopped olives and hard-boiled eggs. Let the filling cool.
        
        <br><br>5. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
        
        <br><br>6. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cutter or a small plate to cut out circles, around 5-6 inches in diameter.
        
        <br><br>7. Spoon a generous amount of the beef filling onto one half of each dough circle. Fold the other half over, creating a half-moon shape, and press the edges together to seal. You can crimp the edges with a fork to ensure they stay closed.
        
        <br><br>8. Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with beaten egg for a shiny finish, if desired.
        
        <br><br>9. Bake the empanadas for about 20-25 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.
        
        <br><br>Once they're out of the oven, let the empanadas cool slightly before serving. These Argentine delights are perfect as a snack or a main course. Enjoy them with chimichurri sauce or your favorite dipping sauce. ¡Buen provecho!
